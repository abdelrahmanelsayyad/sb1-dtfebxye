## Environment

No environment variables are required for the n8n integration. The webhook URL
is embedded directly in the code:

```
https://n8n.srv872107.hstgr.cloud/webhook/8d7fd1cb-4b17-409b-b890-73fb176a1673
```

All campaign details are posted to this endpoint when a user launches a social
listening campaign.
